# Kukuloco custom split ergonomics keyboard
Based on [temper](https://github.com/raeedcho/temper) that itself is a great continuation of [chocofi](https://github.com/pashutk/chocofi/).

## Hardware
TODO: add BOM

## Firmware
I use a Nice Nano v2 so I can be wireless. This means that I use zmk instead of qmk. Luckily [zmk.studio](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/studio) got recently released, so we can change our keymaps on the fly. The firmware will be created in an github action and you can use zmk.studio.

### Acknowledgements
